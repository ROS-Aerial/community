## Development Kanban Board

Developers in the ROS Aerial Working Group keep track of their work for outdoor 3D planning [in a Kanban board.](https://github.com/orgs/ROS-Aerial/projects/3/views/1).

## Goals

* Making an overview of all (online) documentation about aerial robotics such as the [Aerial Robotics landscape](https://github.com/ROS-Aerial/aerial_robotic_landscape)
* Upkeep and updating of the documentation
