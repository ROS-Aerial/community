# Simulation

This page is a central landing page for simulations in aerial robotics. 

## Development Kanban Board

Developers in the ROS Aerial Working Group keep track of their work for simulation [in a Kanban board](https://github.com/orgs/ROS-Aerial/projects/5).

## Goals

* Review the requirements from the community.
* Gather data and choose the most suitable simulation tools/platforms based on the data.
* Create/modify packages to facilitate the community requirements.
* Keeping it well documented.

## Repositories
