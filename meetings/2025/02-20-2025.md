### Roundtable

* Who is working on what project?
* Has somebody seen an interesting project?
* Any request for help?

Projects:
* Robin Meuller shared AutoAPMS, which intergrates behavior trees with PX4. 
    * https://github.com/robin-mueller/auto-apms
    * [Discourse post](https://discourse.ros.org/t/autoapms-a-unified-software-framework-for-creating-behavior-based-robotic-applications/41835)
* Michael is the new ROS project lead. Please connect if you want to give feedback on how to improve ROS for aerial Robotics 
* Ardupilot Pierre Kancir:
    * My blog post about how to use remote controler like herelink to share video ou passthrough any TCP port from the airunit
    * https://discuss.ardupilot.org/t/integrated-remote-controller-video-sharing-herelink-siyi-etc/130034


### Guest Presentation

Guest: Patrik PÃ¶rdi
Project: ROS 2 in the ARK Ecosystem ([youtube playing list](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BJB3OAo3tw&list=PLUepQApgwSoyIdgrab7oNXktWxaxzTcKm))

**Questions from chat**

* What does challenged precision landing mean?
    * That it able to handle precsison landing with sensor noises
*  What are some example use cases for the LLM jetson integration?
    *  We are experimenting with various new models for executing missions. Also we are using SLAM with LLMs. We also have a blogpost on deepseek executing missions
*  Any particular hardware or sensors that you are excited about coming along?
    *  Yes. The flow and range sensor. We will come out with a high range for 70-80 meters range for that. Also a Jetson carrier board that will come out as well. 
*  I would like to ask about high accuracy object detection, how we can do it in our drone and what is the steps to do this?
    *  C++ is the faster for that. You need a good usb camera, with Ubuntu. But specific classification you'll need to make another classified model. 

### Discussion

ROS2 aerial robotics at ROSCon 2025 workshops?

* Everyone is for it (10/0)
* Michael - Workshops are great
* Don- It would be great to have a beginner workshop. Even those who are experienced in robotics its difficult to start in aerial robotics.
* Michael - width is more important than depth
* (I've given up making notes of this :P I'll get this from the annotations later)

### Next meeting

We are moving the meetings to every 3rd Thursday of the month, still on 5 pm UTC.

Next meeting will be on **Thursday, March 20th, 5 pm UTC**. 

: Pierre Kancir from Ardupilot (awaiting definite confirming)


Add the [ROS community event calendar ](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=c_3fc5c4d6ece9d80d49f136c1dcd54d7f44e1acefdbe87228c92ff268e85e2ea0@group.calendar.google.com&ctz=UTC)to your calendar to see our planned meetings.
We also post an announcement [Aerial Vehicles category](https://discourse.ros.org/c/aerial-vehicles/14) on ROS discourse with the [wg-aerial-robotics tag](https://discourse.ros.org/tag/wg-aerial-robotics) about one week before the meeting starts.
