### Announcements

* Happy new year!
* Kim is a 'private citizen' now
* We are trying out a new noting system now instead of slides for easier note taking. Link is https://hackmd.io/@yQAyqQaBSrCT2YGqySXo0A/HkEFoBTv1g/edit
* **FOSDEM 2025** Robotics and Development Room with Two aerial robotics talks about Aerial Robotics.
  * See the schedule here: https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/track/robotics/. Live recording is available

### Guest Presentation

Guest: Kousheek Chakraborty
Project: [NMPC PX4 + ROS 2 Tractory Tracking Controller](https://github.com/kousheekc/nmpc_px4_ros2)
Link to Presentation: link here

**Questions from chat**
**Q:** Did it solve the water jet problem and the drone keeps its position ?

**R:** YES, we are working on the paper, we will be sharing videos on discord soon.

**Q:** to understand how nmpc performs better than mpc, can you explain how would mpc behave when told to follow this '8' trajectory?

**R:** The solver linearizes the trajectory, and it follows that

**Q:** how exactly do you measure 'how good' this nmpc controller is?

**R:** the simplest way is to measure the root square error vs the route based trajectory

**Q:** What is the direct controlling of actuators? Is it PWM?

**R:** We are not controlling at the PWM level. The api allows you to control the RPM.

**Q:** Were there any issues related to delay between FC and companion computer?

**R:** Jetson board with FC intergrated directly with UDP intergrated

**Q:** At what frequency does the nmpc run?

**R:** 200hz it can be faster, but we locked this number

**Q:** For the wildfire use case, how do you perform the visual odometry in smoke and account for high winds?
**R:** Outdoors it is based on RTK GPS, but VO is included. In Simulation there is a gazebo environment which simulates winds and it works fine with that.

**Q:** What was the thoughest challenge to solve?
**R:** Being able to talk to the C code being generated, with linking ROS to it (integration). Also finetuning the weight of the MPC controller was compliciated.

**Q:** Have you considered the possibility of Reinforcement Learning?
**R:** Yes its related. But when working with a drone it doesn't make sense to run.

**Q:** can you provide the trajectory error for the proposed controller?
**R:** Yes, the package is open source so you can check it. I'll do it immediately and send it to you.

**Q:** If I wanted to deploy this on another drone (different size and weight), would it be plug and play or do I need to know precise dynamics of my drone?

**R:** You'll need to define the inertia matrix and once that is defined its pretty much plug and play.


**Q:** What can we do as the Aerial Robotics community to help you with this project or what would have been nice for you to know once you started.

**R:** Testing the project is always handy (for bug reporting). It would also be good to test this out with different types of drones. 


### Next meeting

We are moving the meetings to every 3rd Thursday of the month, still on 5 pm UTC.

Next meeting will be on **Thursday, February 20th, 5 pm UTC**


Add the [ROS community event calendar ](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=c_3fc5c4d6ece9d80d49f136c1dcd54d7f44e1acefdbe87228c92ff268e85e2ea0@group.calendar.google.com&ctz=UTC)to your calendar to see our planned meetings.
We also post an announcement [Aerial Vehicles category](https://discourse.ros.org/c/aerial-vehicles/14) on ROS discourse with the [wg-aerial-robotics tag](https://discourse.ros.org/tag/wg-aerial-robotics) about one week before the meeting starts.
